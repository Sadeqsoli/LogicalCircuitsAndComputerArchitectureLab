# Logical Circuits And Computer Architecture Lab

This repository contains five different little circuit projects implemented in Proteus 8. Each project focuses on various aspects of logical circuits and computer architecture.

## Projects

1. **Arithmetic Circuits**: This project demonstrates various arithmetic circuits such as adders, subtractors, and multipliers.
2. **Decoder 2x4 and 3x8**: Here, you'll find implementations of decoder circuits for both 2x4 and 3x8 configurations.
3. **Local Bus**: The local bus project showcases the design and implementation of a local bus architecture.
4. **Logical Circuit**: This project focuses on different types of logical circuits, including AND, OR, XOR, etc.
5. **Multiplexer 4x1**: Lastly, you'll find a multiplexer circuit with a 4x1 configuration.

## Tools Used

The projects are implemented using Proteus 8, a software tool for electronic design automation (EDA). Proteus allows for the design, simulation, and testing of electronic circuits.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the individual project folders in Proteus 8.
3. Explore the circuit designs and simulations within Proteus.
4. Modify or enhance the circuits as needed for your own learning or experimentation.
